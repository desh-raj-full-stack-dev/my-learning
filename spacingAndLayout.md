## Spacing And Layout

Let's talk about another very important aspect of visual design, how to design a layout using whitespace, every piece of good design uses whitespace.

Well, in fact, if you want to make a website that looks designed, you need a lot of whitespace in the correct places on your site.

### what is white space?

White space is just a space where there isn't any stuff easy.

White space absolutely is the key to create a clean and simple look and feel.

This website uses wide space quite well.

Look at the space between the icons and to text the space between sections, between the sections, headings and its content and between paragraphs just makes the website look clean and inviting, all because it uses wide space in a well executed well.

1. Use white space.

   - Put white space between your elements.
   - Put white space between your groups of elements.
   - Put white space between your website's sections.
   - But don't exaggerate.

   Hierarchies give you a website order, and so it's kind of important that you get it right.

   And how do you do it justice with having three simple guidelines in mind?

   - Define where you want your audience to look first.

   - Establish a flow that corresponds to your content message, because hierarchy is exactly that. It guides the user from one element to the next.

   - Use wide space to build that exact flow.
